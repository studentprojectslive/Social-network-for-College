            <h1>Barak Valley Engineering College</h1>
            <p>
           Barak Valley Engineering College was established in 2017 by Assam Government at Karimganj district, Assam. On 2 March 2011, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi laid the foundation stone of the Barak Valley Engineering College in Karimganj district, which was proposed by the Assam Government officially.

The college starts to offer B.E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering and Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from academic year 2017â€“18. The college is accredited by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). The institution is affiliated to Assam Science and Technology University.

It is the fifth state government engineering college of Assam and first in Barak Valley..</p>
             <h1>Vision & Motto</h1>
            <p>To be an academic institution that strives for excellence in education 
and technology to contribute to the social, economic and ecological 
aspects of the country.</p>
              <h1>Message from principal</h1>
            <p>I am very much delighted to convey my warm greetings to all the Faculty, Staffs and the students fraternity of Barak Valley Engineering College (BVEC). Owing to rapid social and technological changes taking 
place around us, there is an increasing need for quality engineers who 
can think creatively, apply their intelligence to solve problems and to 
create new designs and products for the ever changing world. With our 
very first batch on the verge of graduation, T&P Cell is likely to play vital 
role in the placements of the students. Our mission is to mould highly 
competent technical professionals with wide range of analytic, strategic and leadership skills capable of facing the challenges of the technical world. Our students have already proven their worth with exceptional pursuances, academically as well as in other competitive exams. 
We envisage BVEC would play a central role in imparting skill development programmes to the youth of this region in particular, such that, it 
helps in local employment generation, prosperity and an overall development of the whole society. I hope this institute lives by the saying by 
Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, "The true teachers are those who help us 
think for ourselves". Today it has grown phenomenally. It has attained Academic Autonomy in 2007 and made its first foray into Post graduate education in 2008.A sprawling campus with the state of the art facilities including women's hostel, it is well located in the heart of the city and offers Undergraduate and Post Graduates Progammes that are holistic where academic excellence runs parallel to emotional, social and spiritual formation. </p>
